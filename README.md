## Hi there 👋

# About

![Lizzie Todd](link-to-image-on-github-or-web)

**b. 1986, HK.**  
I’m **Lizzie**, a Product Designer living in **Cincinnati, OH**.

I have **5+ years experience** in UI/UX design, working with startups launching their first product all the way to a fast-growing FinTech company with over **1M+ users**.

## Philosophy

I enjoy user experience design and user research because it combines my two passions: **creative problem solving** and **social equality & accessibility**.

I believe design is **positive change**.

I think products and experiences should **aid users in their goals**, not stand in the way of them. Because of this, I strive to create experiences that are informed by **real insights** and a **true understanding of the user**.

- Reading manga  
- Hanging out with my mini dachshund, *Daisy*  
- Going to boxing class  
- Finding the best dairy-free cheeses to eat
